[Unlimited](http://sfearl1.github.io/vt-tech-challenge/)

###About###
**Unlimited** is my submission for the Front End technical assessment with Varsity Tutors. It is a two page responsive web site which consists of a single scrolling web page and a checkout form/cart.

###Concept###
The Unlimited concept is a loose spin-off of the movie *"[Limitless](http://www.iamrogue.com/limitless/fullsite/index.html)"*. The logo is actually a variation of an unused/recycled logo from an old project of mine. It seemed to fit this one perfectly.  The 3D can rendering, background video, and cityscape background images were found on various stock art web sites.  I tweaked the image assets to match the overall theme of the project.

###Development###
The Unlimited [site](http://sfearl1.github.io/vt-tech-challenge/) is built on top of [Bootstrap 3.3.5](http://getbootstrap.com/) and uses SCSS/[Compass]( http://compass-style.org/) for styling. It also uses a few miscellaneous CSS/JS libraries for interaction, feature detection and cross-browser polyfill support. 

###Setup###
The site is a simple, static html web site. To begin local development:

1. Clone the repo: `git@github.com:sfearl1/vt-tech-challenge.git`
2. Run `bundle install` inside of the project root to pull down all of the project's dependancies.

###Final Thoughts###
I am confident this web site satisfies the requirements for the front end challenge. I had a blast working on this project and look forward to the critique and code review.

Thank you again for the opportunity!
